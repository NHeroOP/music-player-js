### What I learned

I learnt many things, so some of the highlights are down below


```css
.some-element {
  background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(154,59,103,1) 0%, rgba(66,67,116,1) 62%);
}
```
```js
  const width = this.clientWidth;
  const clickX = e.offsetX
  const duration = audio.duration 

  audio.currentTime = (clickX / width) * duration;
```


### Continued development

I will continue to update this site and make it fully working music site using frameworks because vanilla js after learning those frameworks
